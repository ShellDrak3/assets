          <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am SharkesPlayz and I am a British guy just playing roblox. I have been playing Roblox for over 4 years. 
            <br> 
            For the past 3+ years I have been a developer in many different forms. A Basic Scripter, a Basic Animator, an Ametur GUI Developer, an Ametur GFX Designer and the one that has stuck, Advanced Builder. 
            <br>
            This website is a showcase of my latest skills and projects, and a showcase of where I have begun and where I am today, as you can see below. You can also use this website to contact me and explore my prices as a developer.  
            <br> <br>
            In these 4 long years, I have also been in many groups and have experienced many different groups and communities varying from Citizen to Group Owner. 
            <br>
            This website also shows of my experience in all the sectors I have been apart of, including Police, Army, Development, Administration and Airline experience.
